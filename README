The Barbeque Run-Time Resource Manager is a framework being developed at DEIB
- Politecnico di Milano under the context of the several EU funded projects.

This framework is the core of an highly modular and extensible run-time
resource manager which provide support for an easy integration and management
of multiple applications competing on the usage of one (or more) computing
devices, including multi-core processors, SIMD many-core devices and
general-purpose GPUs. The framework design, which exposes different plugin
interfaces, provides support for pluggable policies for both resource
scheduling and the management of applications coordination and
reconfiguration.
