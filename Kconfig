  Enable this option only if the recipes feature information about some
  performance counters based statistics. and the scheduling policy implements
  the support to exploit such information. This potentially leads to a more
  effective binding (i.e. selection of the resource domain of the AWM) in order
  to establish whether it is better to co-schedule applications on the same
  resource binding domain (e.g., CPU node) or spread them among different
  domains.

config BBQUE_RTLIB_PERF_SUPPORT
  bool "Performance Counters Profiling Support"
  depends on TARGET_LINUX
  default y
  ---help---
  Build the Run-Time Library (RTLib) with support for Performance Counters.
  These counters allows an application, which has been integrated with the
  RTLib, to collect transparently a set of profiling information related
  to the run-time execution.

  This option is useful to port easily the RTLib on platforms not supporting
  performance counters, such as some Android devices with older kernels.

  depends on !BBQUE_TEST_PLATFORM_DATA

  ---help---
  Build the Run-Time Library (RTLib) with support for CGroups.
  This framework allows an application, which has been integrated with the
  RTLib, to collect transparently a set of profiling information related
  to the run-time execution.

  This option is useful to port easily the RTLib on platforms not supporting
  or using CGroups for run-time resources management, such as some Android
  devices.

config BBQUE_RTLIB_UNMANAGED_SUPPORT
  bool "Unmanaged Applications Support"
  depends on TARGET_LINUX
  default y
  ---help---
  Build the Run-Time Library (RTLib) with support for UNMANAGED applications.

  An application running in UNMANAGED mode is not controlled by the BarbequRTRM and
  its automatically configured by the RTLib to run in AWM 0 (by default).
  Once this support is enabled, an application could be executed un UNMANAGED mode
  by setting the "U" flag in the BBQUE_RTLIB_OPTS environment variable.
  Such flag could be followed by the ID of the AWM the application should be configured
  to run into, for example:
    BBQUE_RTLIB_OPTS="U3"
  will run the application in AWM 3.

  This option is useful to run applications without BarbequeRTRM control, for example to
  easily support Design Space Exploration (DSE) or the initial development stages of
  a new application.

  Say NO to this option if unsure.

  ---help---
  Each time the Runtime Library forwards a runtime profile to the BarbequeRTRM,
  the forwarding is inhibited to avoid high forwarding rates. By changing
  this option, the inhibition time can be changed. Note that the value is
  expressed in milliseconds.

config BBQUE_RTLIB_RTPROF_WAIT_FOR_SYNC_MS
  int "Runtime Profiles Forwarding Wait For Sync Time [ms]"
  default 5000
  ---help---
  Each time the Runtime Library forwards a runtime profile to the BarbequeRTRM,
  the forwarding is inhibited until the BarbequeRTRM modifies the resource allocation.
  If the BarbequeRTRM does not change the allocation for a certain period of time,
  the Runtime Library become once again able to forward runtime profiles.

comment "Advanced Options"

config BBQUE_YM_SYNC_FORCE
  bool "Synchronization Point forcing"
  default n
  ---help---
  Enable the Sync Point forcing via Synchronization Manager and RTLib.

  By selecting this option, the Synchronization Manager (YM) enforce EXCs
  reconfiguration to be aligned with the synchronization latency defined by
  applications being reconfigured.
  The synchronization latency is the time delay required by an application to
  be in a synchronization point, i.e. complete the current run and being ready
  to start a new one.

  In general this option could be keept disabled, since it is mandatory just
  on few specific platforms and programming paradigms combinations.
  Specifically, it should be explicitly enabled just when a resource
  contention treat could be expected on a specific target platform or
  programming paradigm.

  NOTE: disabling Sync Point Enforcing is corrently not completely safe and
        could lead to a reconfiguration miss for some applications.
        Use this feature at your own risk.

  If unsure, select N

config BBQUE_YP_SASB_ASYNC
  bool "Parallel Re-configurations"
  default n if TARGET_ANDROID
  default y
  ---help---
  Build the SASM policy with support for asynchronous protocol calls.

  By selecting this option, the synchronization protocol is executed with
  asynchronous calls which means that the interaction with applications to be
  re-configured is parallelized, i.e. each protocol requets is managed by a
  dedicated thread and all them runs in parallel.

  Select this option if you plan to run the BarbequeRTRM daemon on a multi-core
  host machine and with a average high number of concurrent applications.

  If unsure, select Y. Select N for Android targets.

  Build the BarbequeRTRM with support for Event Management (EM).

  The Event Manager is a component for tracing internal BarbequeRTRM events.
  The events archive can be then plotted by using the Event Viewer tool.

  If unsure say no, this will disable all the EM related features.
