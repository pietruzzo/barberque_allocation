	 * must be solved in order to make the request of resources satisfiable.
	 *
	 * The function member takes the resource type we want to bind (i.e.
	 * "CPU"), its source ID number (as specified in the recipe), and the
	 * destination ID related to the system resource to bind. Thus it builds
	 * a UsagesMap, wherein the ResourcePath objects, featuring the resource
	 * type specified, have the destination ID number in place of the source
	 * ID.
	 *
	 * @param r_type The type of resource to bind
	 * @param src_ID Recipe resource name ID
	 * @param dst_ID System resource name ID
	 * @param b_id An optional binding identifier
	 *
	 * @return WM_SUCCESS if the binding has been correctly performed.
	 * WM_ERR_RSRC_TYPE if the resource type specified is not correct, and
	 * WM_BIND_ID_OVERFLOW in case of binding ID provided overflow. In this
	 * regards the maximum number is defined by MAX_R_ID_NUM macro.
	 *
	 * @note Use R_ID_ANY if you want to bind the resource without care
	 * about its ID.
